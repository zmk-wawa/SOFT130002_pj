            <em>Christ\'s Entry Into Brussels</em> in 1889 (also known as Entry of Christ into Brussels) is an
            1888 painting by James Ensor. The painting is on permanent exhibition at the Getty Center in Los
            Angeles.', 1889, 'Expressionism', 253, 431, 400, 54, 1, NULL, '2016-03-17 17:32:57')

            Monet left much of his late work unfinished and released few paintings for sale, reporting that he
            was not yet satisfied and was still working on them \"with passion.\" This canvas is one of four
            water-lily pictures that, quite exceptionally, he did complete, sign, and sell in 1919.', 1919,

            In the later part of his life, Van Gogh committed himself to an asylum in Saint Remy de Provence.
            <em>The Starry Night</em> was the view from the window in Van Gogh’s sanitarium bedroom. Although
            it is a night scene, it was painted during the day. The painting is often referred to as Van Gogh’s
            magnus opus. As he often sent his works to his brother Theo for his approval, he mailed this one to
            him in late 1889. He also wrote that he was not so happy about the work, which did not seem complete,
            as he had originally intended it to simply be a study of the night sky.', 1889, 'Post-Impressionism',
